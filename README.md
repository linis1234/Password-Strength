# Password-Strength  
A password is a string of characters used to verify the identity of a user during the authentication process. Passwords are typically used in tandem with a username; they are designed to be known only to the user and allow that user to gain access to a device, application or website.

# Tips Learned from Evaluation 
-Length matters: The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.   

-Avoid dictionary words: Even with numbers or symbols, common words are weak.  

-Mix character types: Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  

-Unpredictability is key: Random character strings are significantly stronger.  

-Substitution alone isn't enough: Replacing "a" with "@" doesn’t stop smart attackers.  

-No personal info: Avoid names, birthdays, or common phrases.            

# What Makes a Good Password?  
-A password should be at least 12 characters long (ideally 16 characters or more); our password-related research has found that 45 percent of Americans use passwords of eight characters or less, which are not as secure as longer passwords.  
-A password should include a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and characters.  
-You must have a unique password for each online account.  
-A password shouldn’t include any of your personal information like your birthday or address, as identity theft and data breaches can compromise such information. It’s also best not to include any information that can be accessed on social media like kids’ or pets’ names.  
-A password shouldn’t contain any consecutive letters or numbers (i.e. ABCD, 1234, etc.)  
-A password shouldn’t be the word “password” or the same letter or number repeated.
