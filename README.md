# Password-Strength  
A password is a string of characters used to verify the identity of a user during the authentication process. Passwords are typically used in tandem with a username; they are designed to be known only to the user and allow that user to gain access to a device, application or website.

__Tips Learned from Evaluation__
-Length matters: The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.   

-Avoid dictionary words: Even with numbers or symbols, common words are weak.  

-Mix character types: Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  

-Unpredictability is key: Random character strings are significantly stronger.  

-Substitution alone isn't enough: Replacing "a" with "@" doesnâ€™t stop smart attackers.  

-No personal info: Avoid names, birthdays, or common phrases.
